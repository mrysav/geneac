# History

I ([Mitchell Rysavy](https://mitchellrysavy.com)) started working on a website to store and share my genealogy research while I was an undergraduate student
at the [University of Minnesota-Duluth](https://d.umn.edu/). Originally, the project was called 'familiar,' and
I used this as the basis for a capstone project in the Honors program.

You can see the original paper and poster on the [University of Minnesota Library's Digital Conservancy](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/193370).
