**Geneac** is a sitebuilder for people who are interested in sharing their genealogy.

If you are interested in using Geneac, check out the **User Guide** to the left.

If you want to start hacking on Geneac, take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mrysav/geneac/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the repository. Then you can check out the [developer quickstart](development/quickstart).

## History

Geneac is a product written mostly by me, [Mitchell Rysavy](https://mitchellrysavy.com). I started working on a website to store and share my genealogy research while I was an undergraduate student
at the [University of Minnesota-Duluth](https://d.umn.edu/). Originally, the project was called 'familiar,' and
I used this as the basis for a capstone project in the Honors program.

You can see the original paper and poster on the [University of Minnesota Library's Digital Conservancy](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/193370).
